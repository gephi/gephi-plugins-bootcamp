#TODO

To-do:
1. add transparency for nodes based on weight
2. make transparency for nodes optional
3. make the node weight attraction more meaningful
4. make good visualizations to be tested
5. Make app more robust (OR CATCH EXCEPTIONS AND TELL USER WHAT TO DO)

  ii. Figure out exception if data in incorrect (non-double) formatâ€¦. Either be able to handle this or catch exception

  iii. Catch exception if there exists a node weight outside of the provided range

6. test some use-cases to see what errors appear


Done:
 check and validate if the column already exists
  1a. check whether the column is dynamic
 add a column that can accept dynamic or not dynamic value
  called "weight"

    i. Resolve use of weight vs weight_dynamic
  Check if weight is dynamic; check if dynamic_weight is dynamic; use whichever one exists
