#OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
#    Example of Layout Plugins:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Grid Layout:</b> Place all nodes in a simple grid. \
#    Users can configure the size of the area and the speed.\
#    </li>\n<li><b>Sorted Grid Layout:</b> Same example as Grid Layout but users can sort nodes with an attribute column.\
#    </li>\n</ul>

NodeWeight.name=Node Weight
NodeWeight.description=Force Atlas 2 with node weight influence and appearance features.

ForceAtlas2.tuning=Tuning
ForceAtlas2.behavior=Behavior Alternatives
ForceAtlas2.performance=Performance
ForceAtlas2.threads=Threads

# jj2018
ForceAtlas2.opacityMode.name=Opacity mode
ForceAtlas2.opacityMode.desc=Requires data scaled to its standard deviation. Opacity changes according to weight (in preview / export), turn on per-node opacity in preview tab to activate.

ForceAtlas2.heatMapMode.name=Heat Map
ForceAtlas2.heatMapMode.desc=Turn on heat map based on normalized node weights. Requires data scaled to its standard deviation.

ForceAtlas2.heatMapChangeMode.name=Change Heat Map
ForceAtlas2.heatMapChangeMode.desc=Turn on heat map to show change of normalized node weights between time slices in dynamic data.

ForceAtlas2.heatMapChangeModeCB.name=Alternative Change Heat Map (Colorblind accessible)
ForceAtlas2.heatMapChangeModeCB.desc=Turn on heat map to show change of normalized node weights between time slices in dynamic data Requires data scaled to its standard deviation.

ForceAtlas2.nodeWeightScaling.name=Node Weight Influence
ForceAtlas2.nodeWeightScaling.desc=Adjust scaling on node weight attraction. More creates larger distance between nodes.
#


ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.name=Scaling
ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.desc=How much repulsion you want. More makes a more sparse graph.

# annotations by jj2018 on stronger gravity description
ForceAtlas2.gravity.name=Gravity
ForceAtlas2.gravity.desc=Attracts nodes to the center. Prevents islands from drifting away. If negative weight averages in your network, minimum gravity set to avoid nodes floating out of graph space.
ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.name=Stronger Gravity
ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.desc=A stronger gravity law. Highly recommended to keep nodes in graph space.

ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.name=Dissuade Hubs
ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.desc=Distributes attraction along outbound edges. Hubs attract less and thus are pushed to the borders.
ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.name=LinLog mode
ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.desc=Switch ForceAtlas' model from lin-lin to lin-log (tribute to Andreas Noack). Makes clusters more tight.
ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.name=Prevent Overlap
ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.desc=Use only when spatialized. Should not be used with "Approximate Repulsion"
ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.name=Tolerance (speed)
ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.desc=How much swinging you allow. Above 1 discouraged. Lower gives less speed and more precision.
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.name=Approximate Repulsion
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.desc=Barnes Hut optimization: n\u00b2 complexity to n.ln(n) ; allows larger graphs.
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.name=Approximation
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.desc=Theta of the Barnes Hut optimization.
ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.name=Edge Weight Influence
ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.desc=How much influence you give to the edges weight. 0 is "no influence" and 1 is "normal".
ForceAtlas2.threads.name=Threads number
ForceAtlas2.threads.desc=More threads means more speed if your cores can handle it.
